<b>Hi Welcome To Drawing With Turtle</b>

Before I get into what each piece of code does let me show you my best work here:


you can find the code for these two in the <b>_Karlie-Kloss_</b> folder.

Here is what the rest of the code on this repository does:

check out the <b>_basics_</b> folder to see how to draw lines, change the background color and create other simple shapes.

in the <b>_nested_</b> folder you'll see nested squares and circles.
this is a collection of those images:

<img src="./nested.png?raw=true" height="400">

moving on to the <b>_more-complex_</b> folder, here you'll be able to draw, well, more complex shapes:D
here is what they look like:

<img src="./complex.png?raw=true" height="400">

There is so much more you could make using Turtle but I'll stop here as I don't think more knowledge of Turtle will help me at this point in time.
